### Control_strategy

#### Overview

- key information for vertical marker detection
  - important values: **x/y relative to marker, distance to marker, heading towards marker**, pitch/yaw
  - X, Y, Dist, Yaw value

- modes
  - takeoff mode
  - position mode
  - offboard mode

#### [Challenges and Implemented Technologies Used in Autonomous Drone Racing](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/ISR19_Moon.pdf)

- **Team INAOE**
  - The control was implemented with 3 controllers based on the PID (Proportional-Integral-Differential) controller to control height, heading (yaw controller) and forward/sideways motion (pitch and roll controller), trigger in that order once the drone reached a waypoint, current height and yaw was measured with the droneâ€™s altitude and IMU sensors
  -  The reason why the drone took more time in its flight was due to the yaw controller, which spent considerable time in reaching the yaw reference, for instance, right at the outset, the controller spent 25 seconds to reach the first yaw reference
- **UZH**
  - The high-level controller receives as input the reference position, velocity, acceleration and yaw, and produces the desired collective thrust and body rates. These are sent to the low-level controller, which is responsible for body rate control (i.e., transforms the reference body rates into desired torques) and computes the single-rotor thrusts necessary to achieve the reference collective thrust and torques.
