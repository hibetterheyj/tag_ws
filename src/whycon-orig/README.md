## WhyCon

### A precise, efficient and low-cost localization system 

_WhyCon_ is a version of a vision-based localization system that can be used with low-cost web cameras, and achieves millimiter precision with very high performance.
The system is capable of efficient real-time detection and precise position estimation of several circular markers in a video stream. 
It can be used both off-line, as a source of ground-truth for robotics experiments, or on-line as a component of robotic systems that require real-time, precise position estimation.
_WhyCon_ is meant as an alternative to widely used and expensive localization systems. It is fully open-source.
_WhyCon-orig_ is WhyCon's original, minimalistic version that was supposed to be ROS and openCV independent.

#### Where is it described ?

<i>WhyCon</i> was first presented on International Conference on Advanced Robotics 2013 [[2](#references)], later in the Journal of Intelligent and Robotics Systems [[1](#references)] and finally at the Workshop on Open Source Aerial Robotics during the International Conference on Intelligent Robotic Systems, 2015 [[3](#references)]. Its early version was also presented at the International Conference of Robotics and Automation, 2013 [[4](#references)]. An extension of the system, which used a necklace code to add ID's to the tags, achieved a best paper award at the SAC 2017 conference [[5](#references)].
If you decide to use this software for your research, please cite <i>WhyCon</i> using the one of the references provided in this [bibtex](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/gestom/CosPhi/papers/WhyCon.bib) file.

### Setting up WhyCon in ROS

#### Quick setup for initial testing

0. Have ROS Kinetic and appropriate camera driver installed. ROS Melodic should also work but was not tested. Also have a <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration/Tutorials/MonocularCalibration">calibrated camera</a> with distortion model "plumb bob".
1. Install the required <a href="#dependencies">libraries</a>
```
sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libncurses5-dev graphicsmagick-libmagick-dev-compat
```
2. Download the code from GitHub into a catkin workspace and switch to this branch with 
```
git checkout whycon-ros-full 
``` 
3. Compile the code - just type `catkin_make` in workspace directory.
4. Source setup script in package directory into shell enviroment e.g. `source devel/setup.bash`
5. Download, resize and print one circular <a href="id/test.pdf">pattern</a> - you have the pattern also in the <i>id/test.pdf</i> file.
6. Run code by <i>roslaunch</i> and remap subsribed camera topics either on start up through arguments
```
roslaunch whycon_ros whycon.launch camInfo:=/<camera>/camera_info camRaw:=/<camera>/image_raw
```
or rewrite file <a href="launch/whycon.launch">whycon.launch</a> so default values of tags <i>arg</i> called <i>camInfo</i> and <i>camRaw</i> will match topics <i>camera_info</i> and <i>image_raw</i>. Then it's just
```
roslaunch whycon_ros whycon.launch
```
7. If using patterns with encoded ID keep the option <i>identify</i> turned on in <i>rqt_reconfigure</i> and if <b>without ID</b>, then turn it off by adding `identify:=false` to the roslaunch.
8. You should see the image with some numbers below the circle. Pressing <i>D</i> shows the segmentation result.
9. You can change the parameters in <i>rqt_reconfigure</i> which should open together with whycon GUI.

#### Generating tags with ID

1. Folder <a href="id/">id/</a> contains code which generates tags with IDs.
2. Move to the <i>id</i> folder and type `make`.
2. Run `./whycon-id-gen` followed by a number of bits and it will create tags in the working directory.
3. Other program parameters are specified in help `./whycon-id-gen -h`
4. Number of ID bits has to be then passed to whycon on start up. The default value is 5.
```
roslaunch whycon_ros whycon.launch [...] idBits:=...
```
5. Other ID parameters are treated the same way. ID samples as `idSamples:=...` and Hamming distance as `hammingDist:=...`

#### Setting up the coordinate system

1. If you have resized the markers (their default size is 122mm), then adjust their diameter in the <i>rqt_reconfigure</i>.
2. Print additional four circular <a href="id/test.pdf">markers</a> and place to the corners of your (reclangular) operational space.
3. Position and fixate your camera so that it has all four circles in it's field of view.
4. Run whycon and modify the dimensions of the operation space in the <i>rqt_reconfigure</i> - the system will now assume that the four markers are at positions [0,0],[fieldLength,0], [0,fieldWidth],[fieldLength,fieldWidth]. 
5. Adjust the parameter <i>numBots</i> - the number of patterns you want to track plus 4.
6. Once all the patterns are found, press `a` and the four outermost patterns will be used to calculate the coordinate system.
7. Alternatively, you can press `r` and then click the four circles that define the coordinate system.
8. Pressing 1 should show you the patterns' positions in camera-centric coordinates (x-axis equals to camera optical axis), pressing 2 and 3 will display marker coordinates in user-defined 2D or 3D coordinate systems.
9. Pressing `+`,`-` changes the number of localized patterns.

#### Logs, GUI, recording topics

1. GUI can be omitted by passing argument `useGui:=false` at strat up.
2. Video and communication topics can be save using <i>rosbag</i>.

#### GUI key binding

- `h` - show/hide help
- `+` - increase the number of tracked patterns
- `-` - decrease the number of tracked patterns
- `1` - camera coordinate system
- `2` - planar coordinate system
- `3` - 3D coordinate system
- `l` - draw/hide coordinates
- `d` - draw/hide segmentation outcome and print debug info
- `s` - save current image
- `a` - autocalibration (searches for 4 outermost patterns and uses them to establisht the coordinate system)
- `r` - manual calibration (click the 4 calibration patterns with mouse)
- `ESC` - exit WhyCon

- Individual patterns to be tracked can be selected by a mouse click.
- `m` and `n` are recommended to use only with one tracked pattern.
- `m` - prints camera coords and eigenvalues of the first pattern
- `n` - prints image coords and eigenvalues of the first pattern

#### Some additional remarks

1. At this point, you can start experimenting with the syste by adding whatever features you might think useful.
2. We have tried to comment the code so an experienced programmer should be able to alter the system accordingly. However, if you have any questions regarding the code, feel free to contact [Tom Krajnik](http://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Qv3nqgsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) or [Matias Nitsche](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Z0hQoRUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)
3. If you use this localization system for your research, please don't forget to cite at least one relevant paper from these [bibtex](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/gestom/CosPhi/papers/WhyCon.bib) records.
4. Have fun!
